# FastAPI-TDD-Desafio 
## Description
I will develop a backend api as a challenge for myself. Here is the story I will use and its requirements:

To help the commercial team, you must develop a RESTful API
using FastAPI that provides data and functionality to facilitate
communication between the sales team, customers and the company. This API must be
consumed by a Front-End interface, which will be developed by another team.

### Requirements
- Must be created using the TDD technique
- Must be created with FastAPI
- Use Pytest to testing
- Use JWT for authentication
- Implement unit and integration tests.
